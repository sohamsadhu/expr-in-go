Program to implement the expression or expr. Basically a small program that works like expr on Unix, gets the expression and calculates the result of the same.

You need go lang compiler like 6g or gccgo to compile and run this thing.

Not sure if the make file has been done correctly so may or may not work. It just says no target and no make file found. 

The program works for some cases and not for all cases. It works for expression like this one ./expr 2 \* \( 3 + 4 \) / \( 2 - 4 \) but not for an expression like this 3 * ( 4 + ( 7 - 3 ) * 3 ) + 1.

Have tried doing the documentation by making a doc.go file having package documentation but even that doesn't seem to work.

The Algorithms used: 

For conversion from infix to postfix used Dijkstra's Shunting yard Algorithm. Then used the below algorithm to evaluate from postfix expression.
